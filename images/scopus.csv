Structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) set qualitative comparative analysis were employed to test the theoretical model. The research results indicate that AI chatbot conversation quality and its various dimensions positively promote consumers' experiences with AI chatbots. The competence expansion path represented by “perceived competence - creative self-efficacy” and the emotional extension path represented by “perceived warmth - rapport” each play a chain mediation role in this process. The results of fsQCA support these findings and identify different antecedent configurations for enhancing consumers' experiences with AI chatbots. Moreover, they demonstrate the significant role of emotional factors in shaping a satisfying consumers' experience with AI chatbots over both short and long-time spans. The conclusions offer practical guidance for improving chatbot services and advancing human-chatbot interaction. © 2025","AI chatbot conversational quality; AI chatbots; Assemblage theory; Consumer experience","2-s2.0-85214140362"

Some of these agents perform actions, interact with multimedia, hold conversations with humans in natural language, and adaptively respond to a person's actions, verbal contributions, and emotions. Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual's mastery of subject matters, skills, and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human, as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations, called trialogues, involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers), model actions and social interactions, stage arguments, solicit help from the human, and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring, educational games, and interventions to help struggling adult readers. Most of these involve assessment at varying grain sizes to guide the intelligent interaction, but conversation-based assessment with agents is also currently being used in high stakes assessments. © 2017","Conversation-based assessment; Conversational agents; Intelligent tutoring systems; Trialogues","2-s2.0-85017186313"

Based on this premise and guided by various psychological principles that characterize Internet communication and behavior, on the one hand, and by factors related to the provision of emotional support, on the other, an Israeli project with the Hebrew acronym SAHAR was established. The idea behind SAHAR was to initiate an anonymous, confidential online environment that would attract people in a crisis situation and offer them a listening ear, mental support, and warmth, provided by anonymous, skilled helpers. At the heart of this exclusively online service is a content-rich Hebrew website (http://www.sahar.org.il) that provides relevant and continuously updated information for people in need. Accessed through the site, SAHAR offers, in addition, personal communication to users through synchronous and asynchronous support. For group communication, SAHAR provides online forums (a chat room will soon be launched). The website is accessed more than 10,000 times a month, or 350 times a day, a considerable number relative to Israel's small population. Approximately 1000 personal contacts with SAHAR itself take place, each month, of which at least a third of the distressed users are clearly suicidal. The forums receive over 200 new messages a day. SAHAR on numerous occasions has participated in rescue operations of individuals who threatened to commit suicide or were actually in the process of trying. In many other cases, a supportive conversation or a referral to appropriate help resources prevented hasty decisions by highly distressed, desperate people contemplating suicide. Feedback by users also indicates the success of SAHAR as a unique psychological application on the Internet. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

One thousand and forty male (n = 398) and female (n = 642) students of different academic disciplines from the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences were included in the study and grouped under three categories. They were randomly assigned to control (n = 520) and experimental (n = 520) groups. In the qualitative phase, students’ communication enjoyment was debriefed through semi-structured interviews. Simultaneously, in the quantitative phase, once the participants watched simulcast lectures and joined in conversation with Artificial Intelligence-driven (non)-robots, their academic and professional oral skills were assessed. The collected data were the participants’ responses to the interviews and formative assessment of their progress and performance through Objective Structured Video Examinations and Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercises. The interview results suggested that the participants had empathy in joining conversations with robots. The statistical analysis indicated that in performing role-play to teach oral skills to the Artificial Intelligence-driven robot, the participants achieved significantly greater communication competence than those who did role-play for virtual agents.

The introduction of a new class of support technologies— “e-coaching systems”—promises to deliver highly personalized, timely, around-the-clock coaching in a wide variety of domains and to a broad audience. At the same time, the introduction of these systems raises a number of practical and ethical concerns regarding, for example, privacy and personal autonomy, that deserve careful consideration. Unfortunately, constructive conversations about these technologies are hindered by the lack of a precise understanding of what constitutes an e-coaching system and how e-coaching systems differ from other types of behavior change interventions. The broad and inclusive definitions that have been offered in the recent literature facilitate a systematic underestimation of the impact that the introduction of e-coaching systems will have, by allowing discussions to include examples of systems with which people are familiar but which lack the level of sophistication and independence needed for a genuine process of coaching. As a consequence, specific concerns that arise with sophisticated, adaptive systems that form their own perspective on a user’s health and behavior and from that perspective shape persuasive interactions, remain out of focus. This paper aims to remedy this situation by proposing a more narrowly construed definition of e-coaching systems. © 2017, The Author(s).","Behavior change support; Definition; E-coaching systems; Ethics; Policy-making","2-s2.0-85019949169"

Participants (N = 109) reported daily on smartphone communication, face-to-face communication, and emotional well-being for fifteen days. At day six, participants were assigned to a mindfulness-treatment intervention group or a no-treatment control group. The social displacement hypothesis was confirmed at the within-person but not between-person level. Specifically, when someone communicates a lot using her smartphone during a particular day, that person engages in less face-to-face interactions during that same day. However, people who tend to spend a lot of time communicating on their smartphone do not engage in less face-to-face conversations than people who largely refrain from smartphone communication.

Earlier research chiefly examined how robot gaze and voice human-likeness separately influenced users' subjective perception. When implementing gaze on robots with different human-like voices, there has little evidence of their possible interaction effects, particularly on users' visual attention and cerebral activity, which could help to understand the perceptual and cognitive processing of anthropomorphic features. Therefore, a within-subject experiment of voice conversations with diverse robot gaze (gaze versus no gaze) and human-like voices (high human-like versus low human-like) using subjective reporting, eye-tracker, and fNIRS was conducted. The results showed that the robot with gaze or a high human-like voice evoked more pleasure, higher arousal, more perceived likability, and less negative attitudes. Robot gaze significantly increased users' average fixation durations and total fixation time, while voice human-likeness prolonged first fixation durations. Moreover, the robot with a high human-like voice (or gaze) induced increased activity in the left DLPFC and decreased activity in the right Broca's area than that had no gaze (or a low human-like voice). The results suggest that robot gaze might chiefly capture users' sustained attention, voice human-likeness might attract users' initial attention, and they might jointly influence users' perceptual processing of prosodic features and emotional processing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Eye-tracking; fNIRS; Robot gaze; Subjective perception; Voice human-likeness","2-s2.0-85145651205"

Specifically, this study examines how individuals may form group relations with computer agents. An experiment using a between-subject factorial design was conducted to explore the relationship between the two theoretical frameworks. The findings suggested that sharing the same color cues with multiple computer agents would lead to users' group identification with computer agents. Group identification with computer agents would further influence group conformity, conformity intention, group attraction, and group trustworthiness.

Research suggests that the design of the agents’ language impacts trust and cognitive load by making the agent more “human-like”. This research seeks to understand the impacts and limits of two dimensions of language-focused anthropomorphism — the agent's ability to empathize and signal the effort to engage with the users’ feelings through language structure, and the agent's effort to systemize and take agency to drive the conversation using logic. We advance existing Theories of Mind (ToMs) with linguistic empathy theory to explain how language structure and logic used during the conversation impact two dimensions of system trust and cognitive load through systemizing and empathizing. We conducted a behavioral online experiment involving 277 residents who interacted with one of three online systems, varying in their interfaces’ Systemizing–Empathizing capability: A menu-based interface (MUI) (no Systemizing Ability), a non-empathetic chatbot, and an empathetic chatbot (both with Systemizing Ability and Empathizing Ability). Half of the participants were emotionally disturbed to examine the moderating effects of anger. Our results revealed that systemizing, exhibited by both chatbots, lowers cognitive effort. The ability to empathize through language increased perceived helpfulness. While the empathetic chatbot was generally perceived as more trustworthy, this effect was reversed when users experienced anger: There is an uncanny valley effect, where empathizing through words has its limits. These findings advance research on anthropomorphism design and trust in CAs. © 2024","anthropomorphism; behavioral online experiment; cognitive effort; Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) theory; system trust; Theory of Mind (ToM)","2-s2.0-85212575866"

Eleven focus group conversations among 57 adolescents between 15 and 18 years old in Flanders, Belgium were analyzed. The findings demonstrate that social networking sites play an important role in relational information seeking. Pictures and status updates are regarded as the most important source of information about a potential romantic partner. In order to express romantic interest respondents indicated that they would like pictures and status updates from several years ago or that they would initiate a conversation through private messages. The respondents in our sample did not consider being Facebook Official as an important part of a romantic relationship. The adolescents recognized the potential of social networking sites to elicit jealousy and identified forms of controlling behavior such as sharing passwords or monitoring the partners' profiles. A romantic break-up often led to removing ex-partners from one's profile pages and adolescents most frequently observed the posting of emotional status updates by ex-partners as a result of the relationship dissolution.

The first is that humanlike robots have advantages of emotional, functional, and relational interaction with users, and the second is that they have disadvantages of privacy perception. Some researchers have claimed that there would be an optimal anthropomorphism of social robots balancing the two aspects. In this study, we explore the optimal level of verbal anthropomorphism of social robots through privacy perception. We designed social robots’ verbal anthropomorphism with various verbal style cues and conducted two studies related to physical and informational privacy based on three levels of verbal anthropomorphism: high, medium, and low. The results revealed that a medium-level verbal anthropomorphism was preferred by participants in terms of privacy perception, whereas they preferred a high-level verbal anthropomorphism in terms of emotional, functional, and relational aspects. This implies that the optimal level of verbal anthropomorphism of social robots may vary depending on privacy perceptions. Based on these findings, we propose adaptable verbal anthropomorphism design of social robots depending on conversation contexts.

By contrasting social media channels that differ in the affordances of identifiability and networked information access (two traditional predictors of online deliberation), we seek to contribute a deeper understanding of social media and its impact on deliberation. Drawing on the social identification/deindividuation (SIDE) model of computer mediated communication and network theories, we predict that political discussions in Facebook will present a more egalitarian distribution of comments between discussants and higher level of politeness in their messages. Consistent with our theoretical framework, results confirm that Facebook expands the flow of information to other networks and enables more symmetrical conversations among users, whereas politeness is lower in the more anonymous and deindividuated YouTube. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-mediated communication; Facebook; Online deliberation; SIDE theory; Social media; YouTube","2-s2.0-84868674003"

As AI-MC becomes more prevalent, it is important to understand the effects that it has on human interactions and interpersonal relationships. Previous work tells us that in human interactions with intelligent systems, misattribution is common and trust is developed and handled differently than in interactions between humans. This study uses a 2 (successful vs. unsuccessful conversation) x 2 (standard vs. AI-mediated messaging app) between subjects design to explore whether AI mediation has any effects on attribution and trust. We show that the presence of AI-generated smart replies serves to increase perceived trust between human communicators and that, when things go awry, the AI seems to be perceived as a coercive agent, allowing it to function like a moral crumple zone and lessen the responsibility assigned to the other human communicator. These findings suggest that smart replies could be used to improve relationships and perceptions of conversational outcomes between interlocutors. Our findings also add to existing literature regarding perceived agency in smart agents by illustrating that in this type of AI-MC, the AI is considered to have agency only when communication goes awry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC); Artificial intelligence (AI); Attribution; Communication; Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC); Trust","2-s2.0-85078175661"

A long-standing pedagogical practice of learning-by-teaching is powered by a recent advancement of generative AI technologies, yielding our teachable agent called ALTER-Math. This study chronicles one usability testing and three cycles of iterative design and implementation process of ALTER-Math. The three empirical studies involved a total of 320 middle school students and six teachers in authentic classroom settings. The first study was exploratory, focusing on the qualitative feedback from the students and teachers through open-ended surveys, interviews and classroom observations. The second study yielded a medium-high (M = 3.26) quantitative survey result on students' perceived engagement and usability on top of the qualitative findings. Finally, the final study included pre- and post-knowledge tests in a quasi-experimental study design as well as student and teacher interviews. The final study revealed a bigger significant knowledge improvement in students who used ALTER-Math compared to the control group, suggesting a positive impact of AI-powered teachable agents on students' learning. The design implications learned from multiple iterations are discussed to inform the future design of AI-powered learning technologies. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Learning-by-teaching is a long-standing effective pedagogical strategy to enhance students' domain knowledge and feelings of responsibility in learning. Various teachable agents have been developed and have demonstrated benefits in students' learning. Generative AI offers the potential to provide naturalistic, contextualised and adaptive conversations. What this paper adds Develops a novel generative AI-powered teachable agent for middle school mathematics learning, called ALTER-Math. Reports the iterative design process involving empirical classroom implementations of ALTER-Math. Reveals a bigger significant improvement in the student's mathematical knowledge after using ALTER-Math, compared to the control group. Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers can be inspired by this design example of a theoretically grounded generative AI learning technology. Educational technology designers could hear the real voices of students and teachers about the generative AI learning technologies. Researchers and educational technology designers could be directed by the design implications to the future design of AI-powered learning technologies and teachable agents. © 2025 British Educational Research Association.","AI-assisted learning environment; generative AI; learning-by-teaching; mathematics learning; teachable agent","2-s2.0-105005204343"

A conceptual model is proposed after identifying three major AI factors namely, perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy. To test the model, the study employed structural equation modeling using 440 sample. The results indicated that perceived anthropomorphism plays the most significant role in building a positive attitude and purchase intention through digital assistants.

However, due to their complexity and interdisciplinary context, computational tools based on linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), perform a feasible approach to support data analysis and discussion. This study presents a systematic analysis and discusses the constellation-based techniques’ principles, applications, potentialities, and limitations. An exhaustive investigation was performed to collect relevant information on digital databases, and NLP was applied to extract and process data, such as geographical location, classification of knowledge area, keywords extraction, and sentiment perception. Results indicate an upward trend in developing new studies related to constellation techniques within almost 20 countries mentioned in the publications. An extensive predominance of family constellations in psychology, medicine, and public health (94.17%) and Law and legal systems (97.96%) was observed. Also, it seems the publications are highly focused on problem-solving (74.58%). Nonetheless, it was observed an apparent inconsistency between principles and applications in the various constellation techniques. Moreover, the aspects of reproducibility remain insufficiently explored, as well as the ethical issues from facilitators regarding the coherence on how the constellation technique principles are applied. Furthermore, it is feasible to notice the growth of scientific interest in this approach and its benefits as a sustainable support tool for diagnosing problems and possible solutions, as well as, the implementation of social change processes, increasing the perception of systemic relationships in complex environments. The application of this technique in decision-making processes has the potential to be further exploited. To reach this goal, there is the need to progress integrative studies associated with the development of computational tools providing more objective, valuable, and sustainable results for a systemic analysis. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Data analytics; Natural language processing; Sustainability; Systemic constellation; Transdisciplinarity","2-s2.0-85127673725"

The results also listed the discipline's most influential academic institutions and well-known researchers. The popular accompanying fields of analysis as revealed by the word map of the keywords, include ""internet addiction”, “behavioural addiction”, “Facebook addiction”, “anxiety, and “depression”. Thematic analysis suggests that researchers in this field may explore Narcissism, Psychopaths, and Machiavellianism, to provide a better perspective on social media addiction. Also, emerging themes like “Depressive symptoms, Emotional Regulation, and Social Networking Sites (SNS) Addiction” appear to be the new dimensions of social media addiction. The Bibliometric analysis helps the present study make a valuable contribution to the area by helping to provide the direction of the existing work and the future orientation required.

Online real-time interactivity has been increased by the use of avatars. We also investigated the antecedents of online real-time interactivity by focusing on trust, emotional appeal, and social presence. As far as the methodology is concerned, we designated companies using avatars on their websites. We asked respondents to visit these websites and then fill in our questionnaire. We received 945 questionnaires back. As we had several latent variables, we used partial least squares (PLS), a variance-based structural equation modeling method. The results show that online real-time interactivity significantly increases the patronage intention. The results also illustrate the impact of the degree of trust and the emotional appeal on user's perception about the online real-time interactivity. Nevertheless, the impact of the emotional appeal is less relevant compared to the degree of trust. Moreover, the degree of trust in the information found on the website explains user's emotional appeal during the conversation. Finally, avatar's social presence has a significant impact on trust and emotional appeal.

This paradigm limits our understanding of ICTs, as individuals rely primarily on ICTs to converse with close others, in more intimate discussions. To address this limitation, this study examines the use of ICTs by friends engaging in problem-focused discussions. Fifty-three female friend pairs engaged in problem-focused discussions in an ICT-mediated or face-to-face context. Observers rated the degree to which individuals exchanged information, dwelled on negative affect, rehashed problems, and speculated about problems. Participants provided ratings of perceived self-expression, similarity, self-disclosure, positive and negative affect and closeness with the friend. Participants in the ICTs condition reported less positive affect after the conversation than those in the face-to-face condition. Although participants interacting through ICTs exchanged less information, rehashed problems less, and reported lower levels of perceived self-expression, they experienced higher levels of perceived similarity and self-disclosure. Discussing problems through an ICT was indirectly related to dampened closeness through observed information exchanged and enhanced closeness through perceived similarity.

IM-based online conversation enables private, synchronous, interpersonal communication while being invisible and possibly anonymous; facilitates self-disclosure and intimacy; and possesses advantageous features of expressive writing and social support. For adolescents, the use of IM is a legitimate, available, and free alternative vehicle for communicating with peers to ventilate negative emotions and to receive social support and advice. The present study examined effects of IMing friends on the emotional state of distressed adolescents through both pre-post (n = 100) analyses and comparison with an un-distressed group (n = 50). Dependent measures included self-report questionnaires, textual analysis, and expert judges' evaluations of the conversations. Findings revealed that IM conversation significantly contributed to the well-being of distressed adolescents. In addition, participants' level of introversion-extroversion moderated the degree of their perceived emotional relief, so that introverted participants profited from IMing more than did extraverts.

One hundred and forty-six valid events were collected and analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. It was shown that the behaviour process of information re-finding on social media experienced six stages: scene triggering, information demand generating, social media selecting, re-finding, information confirmation and information processing. Forty-eight kinds of information re-finding modes were illustrated and summarised into seven categories according to where and how the information was finally found: following, chat record, keyword, favourites, history, personal dynamics and the like. From further analysis, it was proved that significant differences did exist between varied re-finding behaviour modes in information needs and re-finding time rather than information processing behaviour.

Results of both studies demonstrate that the link between partner phubbing and relationship satisfaction was mediated by feelings of exclusion, less perceived partner responsiveness, and less intimacy. We observed no significant mediation effects of conflict over phone use and jealousy when the three significant mediators were taken into account.

We argue that, when generative AI is seen through a traditional computing lens, its development focuses on optimizing for traditional computing traits that remain in principle unattainable. This risks backgrounding what is most novel and defining about it. As probabilistic technologies, generative AIs do not store, in any traditional sense, any data or content. Rather, essential features of training data become encoded in deep neural networks as patterns, that become practically available as styles. We discuss what happens when the distinction between objects and their appearance dissolves and all aspects of images or text become understood as styles, accessible for exploration and creative combination and generation. For example, defining visual qualities of entities like ‘chair’ or ‘cat’ become available as ‘chair-ness’ or ‘cat-ness’ for creative image generation. We argue that, when understood as style engines, unique generative AI capabilities become conceptualized as complementing traditional computing ones. This will aid both computing practitioners and information systems researchers in reconciling and integrating generative AI into the traditional IS landscape. Our conceptualization leads us to propose four archetypes of generative AI application and use, and to highlight future avenues for information systems research made visible by this conceptualization, as well as implications for practice and policymaking. © 2024 The Authors","AI agents; AI assistants; Generative AI; Large language models; Style engines","2-s2.0-85198717271"

How does this work in online virtual work settings, where most of the communication is text-based? Construal level theory predicts that by offering concrete emotional information, use of nonverbal cues would indicate close interpersonal distance between interlocutors. In two studies, we made comparisons between observers' perceptions of team members' chat conversations that use various digital nonverbal cues, such as non-face emojis and face and non-face GIFs of both positive and negative valence. We found that use of these cues leads observers to perceive greater emotional intensity in the conversation, which was linked to higher perceived closeness among the team members and thus higher participant motivation to join the team, regardless of cue valence. However, emotion displays are not always considered appropriate for the workplace; dual threshold theory suggests that emotion displays that are deemed inappropriate would lead to negative perceptions. In study 3, we compared chat conversations between team members using no emotion displays, face emojis, punctuation markers, or direct emotion words. We found that observers’ perceived appropriateness of the team members' communication affected participant motivation to join the team, while emotion words were perceived as being less appropriate than using any of the digital nonverbal cues. These findings extend the construal level theory and dual threshold theory to virtual text-based workplace environments, while exploring a range of nonverbal cues available in this context and demonstrating the positive impact of digital nonverbal cues with a negative valence. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Construal level theory; Dual threshold theory; Emoji; GIF; Nonverbal cues; Virtual teams","2-s2.0-85184828058"

The move away from traditional paper-based course materials, registration, admissions and support services to the mobile, always-on and always accessible data has driven demand for information and generated new forms of data observable through consumption behaviours. These changes have led to a plethora of data sets that store learning content and track user behaviours. Most recently, new data analytics approaches are creating new ways of understanding trends and behaviours in students that can be used to improve learning design, strengthen student retention, provide early warning signals concerning individual students and help to personalise the learner's experience. This paper proposes a foundational learning analytics model (LAM) for higher education that focuses on the dynamic interaction of stakeholders with their data supported by visual analytics, such as self-organising maps, to generate conversations, shared inquiry and solution-seeking. The model can be applied for other educational institutions interested in using learning analytics processes to support personalised learning and support services.

However, consumer satisfaction with chatbots is mixed. Consumers report frustration with chatbots arising from misunderstood questions, irrelevant responses, and poor integration with human service agents. This study examines whether human-computer interactions can be more personalized by matching consumer personality with congruent machine personality using language. Although the idea that personality is manifested through language, and that people are more likely to be responsive to others with the same personality is well known, there is a dearth of research that examines whether this is consistent for human-computer interactions. Based on a sample of over 57,000 chatbot interactions, this study demonstrates that consumer personality can be predicted during contextual interactions, and that chatbots can be manipulated to ‘assume a personality’ using response language. Matching consumer personality with congruent chatbot personality had a positive impact on consumer engagement with chatbots and purchasing outcomes for interactions involving social gain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chatbot; Human-computer interaction; Personality","2-s2.0-85096463868"

But did the COVID-19 pandemic inadvertently accelerate the pace of AI adoption in pharmaceutical innovation? We answer this question using novel data on pharmaceutical patents. We use two different databases to analyze abstracts of pharmaceutical patents applied in the USA. Topic modeling was used to identify patents with technical artifacts and classify them as treated group AI-adopting patents. An AI dictionary is used to match AI-related keywords in the patent abstracts. Subsequently, using a difference-in-differences research design we observe that both presence and count of AI keywords in pharmaceutical patents have increased with pandemic. An increase in AI is also related to reduced time taken from application to publication of a patent suggesting innovation efficiencies in the industry. Finally, we find that results are driven by firms that have already built AI capability in the past. Our results remain consistent with various robustness checks, and we conclude by discussing managerial and policy implications of our findings. © 2023","AI; Innovation management; Pandemic; Patents; Pharmaceutical industry","2-s2.0-85175868761"

The paradigm is based on the idea that people interact in two ways with their environment: symbolically and physically. The main goal is to show how the paradigm can be applied in the design of interactive systems that offer an acceptable coaching process. As a proof of concept, an e-coaching system is implemented that supports an insomnia therapy on a smartphone. A human coach was replaced by a cooperative virtual coach that is able to interact with a human coachee. In the interface of the system, we distinguish between a set of personalized conversations (“Talk”) and specialized modules that form a coherent structure of input and output facilities (“Tools”). Conversations contained a minimum of variation to exclude unpredictable behavior but included the necessary mechanisms for variation to offer personalized consults and support. A variety of system and user tests was conducted to validate the use of the system. After a 6-week therapy, some users spontaneously reported the experience of building a relationship with the e-coach. It is concluded that the addition of a conversational component fills an important gap in the design of current mobile systems. © 2017, The Author(s).","Automated e-coaching; Cognitive behavior therapy; Conversation; Insomnia; Persuasive strategies; Talk-and-tools; Tools; User interface paradigms; Virtual coach","2-s2.0-85018778174"

Although researchers have explored many possible antecedents of social media fatigue, the additive influences and mechanisms of service provider and user drivers are unclear. Drawing on the conversation of resources theory, the present paper identified information overload and system features overload in using social media, together with users’ privacy invasion and cyberbullying perception as critical antecedents of emotional exhaustion, which was further associated with social media fatigue. Data were collected from 2102 users of the social media, and we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) and Bootstrap to test the proposed theoretical model. The results show that both social-media-related factors (information overload and system features overload) and user-related factors (privacy invasion and cyberbullying) significantly influence emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, these social-media-related and user-related factors indirectly impact social media fatigue through emotional exhaustion. These findings enrich the social media fatigue literature by expanding the antecedence space of social media fatigue and by unveiling the underlying psychological mechanism of the fatigue process. Our research also benefits practitioners by providing implications regarding social media application design, which could play an important role in improving user experiences that facilitate retention. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cyberbullying; Emotional exhaustion; Information overload; Privacy invasion; Social media fatigue; System features overload","2-s2.0-85139047201"

Participants were randomly assigned to different strategies and they discussed one randomly chosen non-adherence situation with the agent. Then, their emotions, acquired information accuracy, completeness, and dialogue experience were rated. Our findings suggest that multiple-choice dialogues may limit response depth, reducing the perceived completeness of behaviour reasons.

We propose an approach called informed AI (IAI) by integrating human domain knowledge into AI to develop effective and reliable data labeling and model explainability processes. We demonstrate and validate the use of IAI by applying it to a social media dataset comprised of conversations between customers and customer support agents to construct a solution – IAI defect explorer (I-AIDE). I-AIDE is utilized to identify product defects and extract the voice of customers to help managers make decisions to improve quality and enhance customer satisfaction. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Data labeling; Dynamic decision-making environments; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)","2-s2.0-85123685165"

We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice.

Many recent advancements in CA technology have attempted to make these interactions more natural and human-like. However, it is currently unclear how human-like traits in a CA impact the way users respond to questions from the CA. In some applications where CAs may be used, detecting deception is important. Design elements that make CA interactions more human-like may induce undesired strategic behaviors from human deceivers to mask their deception. To better understand this interaction, this research investigates the effect of conversational skill—that is, the ability of the CA to mimic human conversation—from CAs on behavioral indicators of deception. Our results show that cues of deception vary depending on CA conversational skill, and that increased conversational skill leads to users engaging in strategic behaviors that are detrimental to deception detection. This finding suggests that for applications in which it is desirable to detect when individuals are lying, the pursuit of more human-like interactions may be counter-productive. © 2019 The Authors","Chatbots; Conversational agents; Conversational skill; Deception; Relevance","2-s2.0-85063730978"

A total of 15 experienced English as a foreign language (EFL) instructors and two LLMs were asked to evaluate three student essays of varying quality. The grading scale comprised five domains: grammar, content, organization, style & expression and mechanics. The results revealed that fine-tuned ChatGPT model demonstrated a very high level of reliability with an intraclass correlation (ICC) score of 0.972, Default ChatGPT model exhibited an ICC score of 0.947 and Bard showed a substantial level of reliability with an ICC score of 0.919. Additionally, a significant overlap was observed in certain domains when comparing the grades assigned by LLMs and human raters. In conclusion, the findings suggest that while LLMs demonstrated a notable consistency and potential for grading competency, further fine-tuning and adjustment are needed for a more nuanced understanding of non-objective essay criteria. The study not only offers insights into the potential use of LLMs in grading student essays but also highlights the need for continued development and research. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, are known for their ability to generate text that mimics human-like conversation and writing. LLMs can perform various tasks, including essay grading. Intraclass correlation (ICC) is a statistical measure used to assess the reliability of ratings given by different raters (in this case, EFL instructors and LLMs). What this paper adds The study makes a unique contribution by directly comparing the grading performance of expert EFL instructors with two LLMs—ChatGPT and Bard—using an analytical grading scale. It provides robust empirical evidence showing high reliability of LLMs in grading essays, supported by high ICC scores. It specifically highlights that the overall efficacy of LLMs extends to certain domains of essay grading. Implications for practice and/or policy The findings open up potential new avenues for utilizing LLMs in academic settings, particularly for grading student essays, thereby possibly alleviating workload of educators. The paper's insistence on the need for further fine-tuning of LLMs underlines the continual interplay between technological advancement and its practical applications.

We explored emotional labor in an online context by examining the degree of emotional presence in mediated service interactions and its relationship with workers' acting strategies (i.e., surface acting, deep acting). Further, we examined if emotional presence and acting strategies predict job satisfaction as well as burnout. Data collected from 130 online customer service workers indicated that they perceive the highest emotional presence in phone conversations, followed by email and chat. Although there was little relationship between emotional presence and acting strategies, those who engage in surface acting are less satisfied with their job and more likely to experience burnout. In addition, those who feel a higher degree of emotional presence over the phone tend to experience higher job satisfaction and less burnout.

Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been mostly developed, applied and shown to be effective in developed countries. Hence, their design and development are mostly guided by the intended user's needs and preferences. In a Western context, ECAs have been found to be beneficial for reducing study stress in university students. There is a pertinent need for use of low cost, effective technology that can aid academic stress reduction in higher educational institutions in developing countries owing to their high youth populations, lack of adequate mental healthcare facilities and associated social stigma. What this paper adds The adaptation and use of ECAs to reduce study stress in higher education students in a developing country is evaluated. The ECA technology is adapted for an Indian context in terms of its physical appearance, colour, speech dialect and dialog content so that it is culturally more aligned to the target population. The ECA engages in an empathic conversation tailored for the Indian students and their COVID-19 context providing them with explanation-backed behaviour recommendations that take their beliefs and goals into account. The ECA provides three types of explanation: belief-only; goal-only; and both belief and goal. Results of a study carried out in an Indian university with 61 students, randomly assigned to one of the explanation types, to capture their demographics, study stress statistics, behaviour change intentions and trust/working alliance with the conversational agent. The major findings include stress reduction across all explanation groups, development of a positive relationship between the ECA and the students regardless of its explanation pattern, and changes in behaviour intentions across all types of explanations for all recommended behaviours. However, differences in change intentions for certain behaviours indicate further tailoring of explanations is required based on the user context. Implications for practice and/or policy The ECA technology has shown promise in terms of stress reduction amongst Indian students. Higher Education Institutions in developing countries could utilise low-cost and widely accessible ECAs to overcome lack of access to human-based support and reluctance to use available services due to stigmatized attitudes to mental health issues. This technology can be further improved and deployed into a larger number of Indian educational institutions leading to a widespread impact on overall student health and wellbeing. Digital technologies to support mental health have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in Western countries. The ECA technology evaluated in our study demonstrates its viability and potential value for use in developing countries, with appropriate tailoring. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.","artificial intelligence; behavior change; embodied conversational agents; human-machine interface; learner attitudes/perceptions; stress management; undergraduate education; virtual assistant","2-s2.0-85121470125"

A 2 × 2 experiment revealed that perceived conversation quality was negatively affected by co-present mobile messaging behavior, while social attraction was not. Whether persons were acquainted or not with the phone user did not moderate this relationship. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To make these conversations realistic, designers anthropomorphized chatbots (e.g., attributed human characteristics to chatbot) by equipping them with personality (warmth/competence), attributable gender (male/female), and role (prevention/diagnosis/therapy). Notwithstanding, scholarly inquiry has predominantly disregarded these factors when ascertaining the proclivity of individuals to utilize chatbots in healthcare. Based on human-machine interactions and counter-stereotypes theories, the aim of this research is to evaluate the conditions under which chatbot anthropomorphism can increase users' satisfaction and intention of using related services. Analyses conducted on a sample of 1147 users show that chatbots' personality does not directly influence intention of being used in healthcare. Instead, this relationship is mediated by chatbots' perceived credibility and user satisfaction, and moderated by chatbots' anthropomorphism, gender, and role. Specifically, when there is a mismatch between chatbot's gender and its stereotypical descriptive property (i.e., competence for female chatbots; warmth for male chatbots), the chatbot is more credible, satisfying, and inviting to use. Moreover, chatbots with female anthropomorphic characteristics or with a low level of anthropomorphism are better suited for prevention roles such as counseling, while chatbots with male characteristics are more appropriate for therapeutic roles. © 2023","Anthropomorphism; Chatbots; Digital health literacy; Healthcare; Intention to use","2-s2.0-85178564759"

The study aims to dissect how Lenny’s long turns contribute to displaying ‘his’ personhood. By analyzing Lenny’s long turn in interaction, we uncover how it consolidates Lenny’s relatable character. Through analysis of a corpus of recorded interactions, the paper highlights the role of turn design in simulating human-like interactions.

The current correlational study among 640 adolescents (Mage = 16.27, SD = 1.60) aimed to take a more nuanced look at the influence of SNS use, by examining the influence of talking about appearance-related topics with friends on Facebook in addition to total amount of Facebook use. The findings showed that appearance conversations on Facebook, but not total amount of Facebook use, was directly related to self-sexualizing behaviors. In addition, both self-objectification and the belief that complying with the prevailing appearance ideals is rewarded (with, for example, popularity, increased self-esteem, and romantic success) proved to be valid explanatory mechanisms for the examined relations. Results further showed that both boys and girls were affected by appearance-focused Facebook use, although girls scored higher on the key variables and the model fit better among the girls. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Appearance conversations; Facebook use; Internalization; Rewards; Self-objectification; Self-sexualization","2-s2.0-85038955806"

From a cognitive perspective, the major challenge lies in the coordination and management of the various channels of information associated with conversation/communication and integrating this information with the virtual space of the environment and the belief space of the user. From computing science, the requirements include conversational competency, use of nonverbal cues, animation consistent with affective states, believability, domain competency and user adaptability. From a learning technologies perspective, the challenge is to maximise the considerable affordances provided by conversational avatars in virtual worlds balanced against ecologically valid investigations regarding utility. Finally, the engineering perspective focuses on the technical competency required to implement effective and functional agents, and the associated costs to enable student access. Taken together, the four perspectives draw attention to the quality of the agent-user interaction, how theory, practice and research are closely intertwined, and the multidisciplinary nature of this area with opportunities for cross fertilisation and collaboration. © 2009 Becta.","","2-s2.0-73149104651"

Explicit consideration of intentions in computer systems might play a significant role for improving communication and collaboration. Nevertheless, web-mediated communication lacks elements that are natural in face-to-face conversation for signalling intention. In this article, we propose so-called Intenticons as a set of emoticons designed (and/or selected) to communicate intentions as an interactive mechanism to support users in expressing intentions. This study presents an experimental analysis to evaluate whether Intenticons designed in a participatory way convey intentions better than emoticons selected by designers in a non-participatory way. We rely on a theoretical framework based on Speech Act Theory and Semiotics to categorize different classes of intentions. The achieved results, based on statistical tests, revealed that the Intenticons were more adequate for most of the intention classes. Our findings demonstrated the value of the user involvement for obtaining adequate emoticons in intention sharing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-mediated communication; Emoticons; Intentions; Meanings; Pragmatics; User participation","2-s2.0-85044857562"

A MANOVA indicated that people communicated with the chatbot for longer durations (but with shorter messages) than they did with another human. Additionally, human-chatbot communication lacked much of the richness of vocabulary found in conversations among people, and exhibited greater profanity. These results suggest that while human language skills transfer easily to human-chatbot communication, there are notable differences in the content and quality of such conversations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
