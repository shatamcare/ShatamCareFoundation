## Deployment

The website can be deployed to various platforms:

### Vercel (Recommended)
```sh
npm run build
# Deploy the 'dist' folder to Vercel
```

### Netlify
```sh
npm run build
# Deploy the 'dist' folder to Netlify
```

### GitHub Pages
```sh
npm run build
# Deploy the 'dist' folder to GitHub Pages
```

### Custom Domain (GitHub Pages with CNAME)

When serving the site at `https://shatamcare.org/` (custom root domain) the Vite `base` must be `/` so the generated hashed asset files (e.g. `assets/main-<hash>.js`) resolve correctly. The build system auto-detects this in two ways:

1. Environment variable `VITE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=true` (see `.env.production`).
2. Presence of a `CNAME` file containing a non `github.io` domain.

If you still see 404 errors for files like `main-XXXX.js` or `react-vendor-XXXX.js` after deployment:

Troubleshooting checklist:
* Confirm the `CNAME` file is committed in the repository root.
* Inspect `dist/index.html` – asset URLs should start with `/assets/` (NOT `/ShatamCareFoundation/assets/`).
* Rebuild explicitly forcing root base:
	```sh
	VITE_BASE=/ npm run build
	```
* Clear GitHub Pages cache by removing the custom domain in Settings → Pages, saving, waiting a minute, then re‑adding it.
* Ensure your browser cache is cleared / use a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5).

For project‑path deployments (e.g. without custom domain) the default base `/ShatamCareFoundation/` is used automatically.
